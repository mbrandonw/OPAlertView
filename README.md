OPAlertView
============

A simple subclass of UIAlertView that gives block based access to the dismissal events. I chose to do this in a subclass instead of a category so that I didn't have do any hacky things with the objc runtime.

##Installation

We love [CocoaPods](http://github.com/cocoapods/cocoapods), so we recommend you use it.
